We have a github repo organized into subdirectories :
  - src     for holding cpp+17 source code
  - prompts for holding GPT 5.2 code prompts
  - build   for holding cmake output binaries compiled from src
  - tests   for holding GPT 5.2 generated gtest unit tests
  - tools   for holding generator tools
We need a cmake skeleton for automating the build into build and tests
of the source code in src that was generated from prompts. The build
system should auto-discover any new directories and source files.
