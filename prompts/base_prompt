Let's say we are generating C++ code, but the scripting is bash + python.
The LLM is OpenAI  ChatGPT 5.2.  We want to generate a subdirectories
`src/<NEW_NAME>/`  of new C++ code using the prompts in `prompts/<NEW_NAME>/`.
One prompt file generates one source code file in `src/<NEW_NAME>`.
Normalize the format of the source code.  Commit the new code to a new
branch `<NEW_NAME>`.  If branch <--> main  diffs are too large, then notify
and break processing. Otherwise continue: The new C++ source code must be
verified for compile + run(tests).  Code is compiled into `build/<NEW_NAME>`.
Testing uses `gtest` : one gtest file in `tests/<NEW_NAME>` for each object
file in `build/<NEW_NAME>`. If tests fail, then notify and break processing.
Otherwise continue:  push new code to the new branch create a new pull request
main <--> NEW_NAME   for the newly generated and tested code.
