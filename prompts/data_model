Define the index storage format as immutable segments 
with background compaction.

Requirements:
  - Upserts and deletes supported
  - Deletes visible in <=4s
  - Rebuilds should not block queries

Specify:
  - segment file layout,
  - in-memory structures,
  - tombstones,
  - manifest,
  - compaction triggers.

Layout format: all data items in each file should be specified as
  <NAME> <TYPE>
  For example: `segid u64, tenant_id u64, shard_id u64 score f16`

Provide a state machine for "segment lifecycle".
